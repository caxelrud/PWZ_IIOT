# Ask a question
We monitor the Github issues section specifically for bugs found with our samples, however we will reply to questions asked using Github issues too.

The Azure IoT team monitors Stack Overflow, especially the [azure-iot-hub](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-iot-hub) tag. It is a great place to ask questions specifically about the various SDKs.

# File a bug (code or documentation)
Bugs are definitely something we want to hear about! Please open an issue on github and we'll try address it as fast as possible. Here's the information we would like from you to get started:
- What sample are you using (NodeJS/JavaScript, C, C#, F#, Python, Java)
- Do you have a snippet of code that would help us reproduce the bug?
- Do you have logs showing what's happening?

Our samples are entirely open-source and we do accept pull-requests if you feel like taking a stab at fixing the bug and maybe adding your name to our commit history :) Please be sure to file an issues first and mention the relevant issue number in your pull request description.

# Contribute documentation
For simple markdown files, we accept documentation pull requests submitted against the `master` branch, if it's about existing sample.  If your PR is about adding samples, sample changes or has changes to the comments in the code itself, we'll treat is as a code change (see the next section).  If you are adding images or other content files for documentation, please place them in an `assest` folder at the same level as the readme.

# Contribute code
Unlike documentation, we require pull-requests for code to be submitted against the `develop` branch in order to review. We try to maintain a high bar
for code quality and maintainability, we request that all code samples are accompanied by documentation and example scenerios.

Also, have you signed the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/))? A friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit your pull-request.

If you feel like your contribution is going to be a major effort, you should probably give us a heads-up. So before you spend the time, just check with us to make
sure your plans and ours are in sync :) Just open an issue on github and tag it "enhancement" or "feature request"
