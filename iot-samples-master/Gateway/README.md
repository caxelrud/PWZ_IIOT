# iot-samples/Gateway
The Azure IoT Gateway SDK can be used to built appplications that allow gateway-connected devices
to communicate to Azure IoT Hub.  Reference applications are organized by language and further by 
platform.  Unlike the projects included under Device Management, platform specific binaries are 
distributed with the source code as gateway applications often do not require modification of the 
underlying gateway application.
