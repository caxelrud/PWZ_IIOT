# iot-samples/AzureFunctions/nodejs
This folder includes a nodejs sample for decompressing and shreding data emitted by the Device Management simulators.  The `DecompShred.js` and `package.json` files can be deployed to your function using these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-reference-node/#node-version-amp-package-management).  The Function input will need to be wired up to the IoT Hub's Event Hub interface and instructions can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-bindings-event-hubs/).
